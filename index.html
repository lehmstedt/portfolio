            <p>I am a French developer who came in Quebec in 2019. I am orienting my developments on SOLID principles, for building maintainable, testable, sensible software for my peers.
                My strategy is to prioritize business rules over infrastructure details, for those details to depend on those rules.
                I allow those business rules to be testable as a living document, and I let its development be guided by unit tests.
                I think business rule progressive ownership is a required way to deliver an elegant solution to product problematic.</p></div>
